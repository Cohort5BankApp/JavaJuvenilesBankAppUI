After cloning the project for the first time make sure to run the command:

npm install

this will install the angular core services that are ignored when uploading
to github.


To pull from master branch to get your code updated, run the command:

git pull origin master

While in your branch. To switch toy your branch:

git checkout "branch name"
example: git checkout william

This command will not replace your code you have been
working on. However, make sure you update your personal branch with your work
if you need to get an updated version of master:

git add .
git commit -m "your comment"
git push

!!!MAKE SURE TO NEVER PUSH TO MASTER BRANCH!!!
